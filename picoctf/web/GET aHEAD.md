I opened the website in burp and intercepted the requests, in the response i could see that if the request was a `GET` request it was for the red colour and if the request was a `POST` request it was
for the blue color so i changed the header of the request from `GET` TO `HEAD` as the challenge name had `HEAD` in it. and i got the flag in the response.
